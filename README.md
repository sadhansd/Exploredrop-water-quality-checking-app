# Exploredrop-water-quality-checking-app

ExploreDrop is an IoT-based application designed for real-time water quality monitoring. The system employs a combination of sensors to measure crucial water parameters such as pH, turbidity, and conductivity. An Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the sensor data, which is subsequently transmitted to a mobile application developed using MIT App Inventor 2. The app provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and interpret the collected water quality data.
